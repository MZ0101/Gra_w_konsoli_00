# **Simple console game**
A simple console game, you can choose the board size. The player controls the vehicle using the A, W, S, D keys and the spacebar to send the missile.
Enemies are placed in the upper part of the board and they send missiles flying to the lower part of the board, i.e. towards the player's vehicle.
The player can shoot down bullets or an enemy, for shooting down an enemy the player gets an additional bullet and a point, the player starts with 20 bullets and 3 lives.
The game ends when the player loses all his lives, i.e. after his vehicle is hit three times by enemy bullets.

  ### **Possible expansion:**
- Transferring the game to a GUI library, e.g. Qt library.
- Adding mechanics for player gaining life.
- Adding a mechanic that allows you to obtain missiles not only by destroying an enemy vehicle.
- Giving results.
